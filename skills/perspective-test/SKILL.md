# User Perspective Test

Test features from a real user's perspective by combining static code analysis with browser-based verification.

## When to Use

- After implementing a feature: "Tests pass but does it actually work?"
- Debugging integration issues: "The component exists but nothing renders"
- Pre-merge validation: "Verify this actually works end-to-end"
- When unit tests pass but something feels off

## The Problem This Solves

Unit tests often pass while features are broken because:
- Tests mock the integration points
- Components are defined but never wired up
- Props/data are passed in tests but not in actual usage
- The "happy path" in tests doesn't match real user flows

**Example:** A test passes because it mocks `projectName` prop, but the actual page never passes that prop - so users see nothing.

## The Three-Layer Verification

### Layer 1: Static Code Analysis

Trace the data flow through the codebase:

```
Where is it defined? → Where is it imported? → Where is it used? → What renders it?
```

**Check for gaps:**
- Function exists but is never called
- Component is imported but not rendered
- Prop is defined but not passed
- Callback is created but never triggered

### Layer 2: Wiring Verification

Verify the connection chain is complete:

```bash
# 1. Find the definition
grep -r "function getProjectName" src/

# 2. Find imports (is it imported?)
grep -r "import.*getProjectName" src/

# 3. Find usage (is it actually called?)
grep -r "getProjectName(" src/

# 4. Trace to UI (does it reach the render?)
# Follow: service → hook → component → JSX
```

**Red flags:**
- Import exists but no usage on the same file
- Function call exists but return value is unused
- Prop is destructured but never rendered
- State is set but component doesn't read it

### Layer 3: Browser Verification

Actually load the app and verify from a user's perspective using `agent-browser`:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the page
agent-browser open http://localhost:3000/path

# 2. Take accessibility snapshot (understand structure)
agent-browser snapshot              # full tree with @refs
agent-browser snapshot -i           # interactive elements only
agent-browser snapshot -c           # compact (no empty structural nodes)

# 3. Look for the expected element/behavior
agent-browser get text @e5          # read text content of a ref
agent-browser find role heading     # find elements by role
agent-browser find text "Submit"    # find by visible text
agent-browser is visible @e5        # check if element is visible

# 4. Interact if needed
agent-browser click @e3             # click by ref from snapshot
agent-browser fill @e4 "test input" # clear + type into input
agent-browser press Enter           # press a key
agent-browser select @e6 "Option"   # select dropdown value

# 5. Verify the outcome
agent-browser snapshot              # re-snapshot to see changes
agent-browser get text @e7          # check updated content

# 6. Check console for errors
agent-browser console               # view console logs
agent-browser errors                # view page errors only

# 7. Capture evidence
agent-browser screenshot            # viewport screenshot
agent-browser screenshot --full     # full page screenshot
```

## Process

### 1. Understand the Feature

Read the implementation to understand:
- What should the user see/experience?
- What's the entry point (URL, button, action)?
- What data should be displayed?

### 2. Trace the Wiring

Starting from the UI component, trace backwards:
```
UI renders X → X comes from prop Y → Y comes from hook Z → Z calls service W
```

Then verify each link in the chain:
- Is W defined and exported?
- Does Z import and call W?
- Does the component call Z?
- Does the parent pass the result as Y?
- Does the UI actually render X?

### 3. Test in Browser

**Pre-flight check:**
```bash
# Is dev server running?
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000
```

**Browser verification:**
```bash
agent-browser open <target-url>
agent-browser snapshot -i            # understand interactive elements
agent-browser click @e3              # interact by ref
agent-browser fill @e4 "input"       # fill form fields
agent-browser errors                 # check for JS errors
agent-browser screenshot             # capture evidence
```

### 4. Compare and Report

| Check | Unit Tests | User Perspective |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| Component renders | ✅ (with mocked props) | ❌ (prop not passed) |
| Data displays | ✅ (test provides data) | ❌ (API not wired) |
| Button works | ✅ (handler exists) | ❌ (never attached) |

## Output Format

```markdown
## User Perspective Test: [feature name]

### Feature Understanding
- Expected behavior: [what user should see]
- Entry point: [URL or action]

### Wiring Trace
- [✓/✗] Definition: `functionName` in `file.ts:42`
- [✓/✗] Import: found in `consumer.ts:3`
- [✓/✗] Usage: called at `consumer.ts:28`
- [✓/✗] UI binding: rendered in `Component.tsx:55`

**Gap found:** [description of missing link, if any]

### Browser Verification
- URL: http://localhost:3000/path
- Expected: [what should appear]
- Actual: [what actually appeared]
- Console errors: [none / list of errors]

### Evidence
[Screenshot or snapshot excerpt]

### Verdict
**PASS** - Feature works as expected from user perspective
or
**FAIL** - [specific issue with location]
  - Root cause: [explanation]
  - Fix: [one-liner or file:line to change]
```

## Common Wiring Failures

### 1. The Phantom Prop
```tsx
// Component expects the prop
function Header({ projectName }: Props) {
  return <div>{projectName}</div>;
}

// Parent never passes it
<Header />  // projectName is undefined!
```

### 2. The Orphan Import
```tsx
import { useFeature } from './hooks';
// ... but useFeature is never called in this file
```

### 3. The Dead Callback
```tsx
const handleClick = () => { /* logic */ };
// ... but no element has onClick={handleClick}
```

### 4. The Silent Fetch
```tsx
const data = await fetchData();
// ... but data is never used or rendered
```

## agent-browser Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Open page | `agent-browser open <url>` |
| Understand structure | `agent-browser snapshot` (full) / `-i` (interactive) / `-c` (compact) |
| Find by role/text | `agent-browser find role button` / `find text "Submit"` |
| Click element | `agent-browser click @e3` |
| Fill input | `agent-browser fill @e3 "text"` |
| Type into element | `agent-browser type @e3 "text"` |
| Press key | `agent-browser press Enter` |
| Select dropdown | `agent-browser select @e3 "Option"` |
| Read text content | `agent-browser get text @e3` |
| Read attribute | `agent-browser get attr href @e3` |
| Check visibility | `agent-browser is visible @e3` |
| Check enabled | `agent-browser is enabled @e3` |
| Check for JS errors | `agent-browser errors` |
| View console logs | `agent-browser console` |
| Screenshot (viewport) | `agent-browser screenshot` |
| Screenshot (full page) | `agent-browser screenshot --full` |
| Wait for element | `agent-browser wait @e3` or `wait "selector"` |
| Wait for time | `agent-browser wait 2000` |
| Scroll | `agent-browser scroll down 500` |
| Set viewport | `agent-browser set viewport 1280 720` |
| Go back | `agent-browser back` |
| Close browser | `agent-browser close` |

**Snapshot is better than screenshot** for understanding what's on the page - it gives you the accessibility tree with `@ref` identifiers you can use directly in subsequent commands (`click @e3`, `fill @e4 "text"`, etc.).

## Key Insight

> Unit tests verify that code works in isolation.
> User perspective tests verify that code works in integration.
> Both are necessary. Neither is sufficient alone.

TDD catches component behavior. User perspective testing catches the wiring gaps.
