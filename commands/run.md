```

## Arguments

- `--wip N` (optional): Set WIP limit (default: 3)
- `--max-wip M` (optional): Set maximum WIP for adaptive scaling (default: 5)

## Pipeline Flow (ALL STAGES MANDATORY)

Each feature MUST flow through ALL stages. **No shortcuts. No exceptions.**

```

**Stage transitions (ALL REQUIRED):**
1. `ready → testing`: Murdock writes tests (and types if specified)
2. `testing → implementing`: B.A. implements to pass tests
3. `implementing → review`: Lynch reviews ALL outputs together
4. `review → probing`: Lynch approves → **Amy MUST investigate** (NOT optional)
5. `probing → done`: Amy verifies (or back to ready if bugs found)
6. `all done → final review`: Lynch reviews entire codebase holistically
7. `final review → post-checks`: Run lint, unit, e2e tests
8. `post-checks → documentation`: **Tawnia MUST run** (NOT optional)
9. `documentation → complete`: Tawnia creates final commit, mission complete

## Pipeline Parallelism

Different features can be at different stages simultaneously:

```
Feature 001: [testing]  →  [implementing]  →  [review]  →  [probing]  →  done
Feature 002:      [testing]  →  [implementing]  →  [review]  →  [probing]
Feature 003:            [testing]  →  [implementing]  →  [review]
```

WIP limit controls how many features are in-flight (not in briefings, ready, or done stages).

## Behavior

1. **Validate mission exists**
   Use `mission_current` MCP tool to check for active mission.
   ```
   if mission not found:
       error "No mission found. Run /ai-team:plan first."
       exit
   ```

2. **Run pre-mission checks**
   Use the `mission_precheck` MCP tool.
   - Ensures codebase is in clean state (lint, unit tests passing)
   - Establishes baseline before mission work begins
   - If checks fail, abort mission and report to user

3. **Detect dispatch mode and load orchestration playbook**

   First, get the plugin root path:
   ```
   plugin_root()  # MCP tool - returns the absolute path to the plugin directory
   ```

   Then check the environment variable:
   ```
   Bash("echo $CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS")
   ```

   Using the plugin root path from above:
   - If output is "1": `Read("{plugin_root}/playbooks/orchestration-native.md")`
   - Otherwise: `Read("{plugin_root}/playbooks/orchestration-legacy.md")`

   **Read exactly ONE playbook. Do not read both.**
   The playbook contains your complete orchestration loop, dispatch
   patterns, completion detection, and concrete examples.

4. **Main Claude becomes Hannibal**
   - Orchestration runs in the main context (visible to user)
   - Worker agents dispatched as direct subagents

5. **Orchestration loop:**
   Follow the loaded orchestration playbook for the complete loop,
   dispatch patterns, and completion detection.
   - Use `board_move` to advance items between stages
   - Use `deps_check` to find items ready to move from briefings → ready
   - Start new features if under WIP limit

6. **Final Mission Review:**
   - When ALL items reach `done` stage, trigger final review
   - Lynch reviews entire codebase for cross-cutting issues
   - Focus: readability, security, race conditions, code quality
   - If FINAL APPROVED → proceed to post-checks
   - If FINAL REJECTED → specified items return to pipeline

7. **Post-Mission Checks:**
   Use the `mission_postcheck` MCP tool.
   - Run after final review approves
   - Verifies lint, unit tests, and e2e tests all pass
   - Updates mission state with postcheck results
   - If checks fail, items return to pipeline for fixes

8. **Documentation Phase (Tawnia):**
   - Dispatch Tawnia when ALL three conditions are met:
     1. All items in `done` stage
     2. Final review passed
     3. Post-checks passed
   - Tawnia updates CHANGELOG.md (always)
   - Tawnia updates README.md (if user-facing changes)
   - Tawnia creates/updates docs/ entries (for complex features)
   - Tawnia makes the **final commit** bundling all mission work + documentation
   - Updates mission state with documentation completion and commit hash

9. **Completion (ALL conditions required):**
   - ✓ All items in `done` stage
   - ✓ Final review passed
   - ✓ Post-checks passed
   - ✓ Tawnia documentation committed ← **REQUIRED**
   - Then and ONLY then: "I love it when a plan comes together."


   **Mission is NOT complete until Tawnia commits. No exceptions.**

   - Items in `blocked` stage → Needs human intervention
   - Post-checks fail → Fix issues before documentation can run

## Example

```
# Default WIP of 3
/ai-team:run

# Higher parallelism
/ai-team:run --wip 4 --max-wip 6

# Sequential (one at a time)
/ai-team:run --wip 1 --max-wip 1
```

## Implementation Notes

**Hannibal runs in the MAIN context, not as a subagent.**

The main Claude session becomes Hannibal and orchestrates directly:

```
Main Claude (as Hannibal)
    ├── subagent → Murdock (testing stage)
    ├── subagent → B.A. (implementing stage)
    ├── subagent → Lynch (review stage, final review)
    ├── subagent → Amy (probing stage)
    └── subagent → Tawnia (documentation, after post-checks pass)
```

This flat structure:
- Gives user visibility into orchestration
- Allows mid-run intervention
- Avoids nested subagent memory overhead

The dispatch mode (legacy Task/TaskOutput vs. native TeamCreate/SendMessage) is determined by the orchestration playbook loaded in step 3.

## MCP Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mission_current` | Check mission exists and get state |
| `mission_precheck` | Run lint/tests before starting |
| `mission_postcheck` | Run lint/tests after all done |
| `board_read` | Get current board state |
| `board_move` | Move items between stages |
| `board_claim` | Assign agent to item |
| `board_release` | Release agent assignment |
| `item_list` | List items by stage |
| `deps_check` | Find items ready to advance |
| `agent_start` | Signal agent beginning work |
| `agent_stop` | Signal agent completed work |
| `log` | Write to activity feed |

## Errors

- **No mission found**: Run `/ai-team:plan` first
- **All items blocked**: Human intervention needed via `/ai-team:unblock`
- **Agent failure**: Item returned to previous stage for retry
- **API unavailable**: Cannot connect to A(i)-Team server
