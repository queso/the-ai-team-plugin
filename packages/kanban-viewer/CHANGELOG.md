## [0.12.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added

#### Editable WIP Limits

Board columns now support inline editing of WIP (Work In Progress) limits with real-time visual feedback.

**New API Endpoint**
- `PATCH /api/stages/:id`: Update WIP limit for a stage
- Validates input (positive integers or null for unlimited)
- Returns 400/404/500 error responses appropriately

**WIP Display Format**
- Column headers now show `count/limit` format (e.g., "3/5")
- Unlimited columns display infinity symbol (e.g., "3/∞")

**Color States**
- Yellow background when at limit (count equals limit)
- Red background when over limit (count exceeds limit)
- Normal styling when under limit

**Inline Editor**
- Click WIP display to edit limit
- Input accepts positive integers or empty for unlimited
- Escape to cancel, Enter or blur to save
- Automatic focus when entering edit mode

### Testing

- Added 73 new tests for editable WIP limits
- API endpoint tests (`src/__tests__/api/stages.test.ts`): 26 tests for validation, edge cases, error handling
- BoardColumn WIP display tests (`src/__tests__/board-column-wip.test.tsx`): 36 tests for display, colors, editor
- Page handler tests (`src/__tests__/page-wip-handler.test.tsx`): 11 tests for API integration

### Technical Details

Mission "Editable WIP Limits" completed:

## [0.11.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added

#### Multi-Item Agent Claims

Agents can now claim multiple work items simultaneously. The only limit is the WIP limit per stage column.

**Schema Changes**
- `AgentClaim` model now uses auto-increment `id` as primary key
- `itemId` remains unique (each item can only have one agent)
- `agentName` indexed for efficient querying
- Removed one-item-per-agent constraint

**WIP Limit Enforcement**
- `/api/agents/start` now checks WIP limit before allowing work to begin
- Returns `WIP_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` error when stage is at capacity
- Allows work when stage has no WIP limit (null)

#### Work Item Card Enhancements

**Work Log Indicator**
- Cards now show work log count: "📄 3 work summaries"
- Singular/plural text ("1 work summary" vs "3 work summaries")
- Uses FileText icon for visual indicator

**Work History Modal Colors**
- Agent names display in their respective colors in work history
- Colored bullet points match each agent's theme color
- Colors: Hannibal (green), Face (cyan), Murdock (amber), B.A. (red), Amy (pink), Lynch (blue), Tawnia (teal)

#### Docker Compose Support

Added `docker-compose.yml` for simplified container management:
- Bind mount for local database persistence (`./prisma/data:/app/prisma/data`)
- Container auto-restart policy
- Commands: `docker compose up -d`, `docker compose down`, `docker compose up -d --build`

### Changed

#### Activity Log Mission Scoping

Activity logs are now properly scoped to the current active mission:
- Only shows logs for the active mission (not archived/completed/failed)
- Returns empty list when no active mission exists
- Prevents stale logs from previous missions appearing after archive

### Fixed

#### Agent Claim Race Conditions

- Updated `AgentClaim` delete operations to use `itemId` (unique) instead of `agentName`
- Fixed `/api/agents/stop` and `/api/board/release` routes

### Testing

- Added WIP limit enforcement tests in `agents/start.test.ts`
- Tests verify: below limit allowed, at capacity rejected, null limit allowed, multiple agents up to limit

## [0.10.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added

#### Multi-Project Support (PRD 014-015)

Complete multi-project isolation with SQLite schema updates and project API.

**Database Schema Updates**
- New `Project` model with id, name, createdAt, updatedAt
- Foreign key relationships: `Item`, `Mission`, `ActivityLog` now belong to projects
- Database indexes on projectId for query performance
- `Item` output fields: `outputTest`, `outputImpl`, `outputTypes` for tracking generated files

**API Endpoints**
- `GET /api/projects`: List all projects
- `POST /api/projects`: Create new project
- Project identification via `X-Project-ID` header (auto-created on first use)

**Project Isolation**
- All API requests require X-Project-ID header
- Work items, missions, activity logs scoped to project
- Database maintains referential integrity with project constraints

#### Item Output File Tracking

Items now track output files generated during implementation:

**New Item Fields**
- `outputTest`: Path to test file (e.g., `src/__tests__/feature.test.ts`)
- `outputImpl`: Path to implementation file (e.g., `src/lib/feature.ts`)
- `outputTypes`: Path to types file (e.g., `src/types/feature.ts`)

**API Support**
- `outputs` field in `CreateItemRequest` and `UpdateItemRequest`
- Output collision detection in dependency validation
- WorkLog entries include outputs for tracking what was created

#### Improved Error Handling

**Error Factory Functions** (`src/lib/errors.ts`)
- Standardized error creation with factory functions
- Each error includes code, message, and contextual details
- Error codes: ITEM_NOT_FOUND, INVALID_TRANSITION, WIP_LIMIT_EXCEEDED, DEPENDENCY_CYCLE, OUTPUT_COLLISION, CLAIM_CONFLICT, VALIDATION_ERROR, UNAUTHORIZED, SERVER_ERROR, DATABASE_ERROR, INVALID_STAGE

**Error Classes**
- `ApiError` class with serialization support
- `ApiErrorResponse` interface for consistent error format
- `OutputCollisionDetail` interface for output conflict reporting

#### Migration Script Updates

- `scripts/migrate-from-json.ts`: Updated to support project-scoped migration
- Preserves all work items, dependencies, and stages during SQLite migration

### Changed

#### Breaking Change: ReleaseItemResponse

The `ReleaseItemResponse.agent` field is now `AgentName | null`:

```typescript
// Before
export interface ReleaseItemResponse {
  agent: AgentName;  // Always present
}

// After
export interface ReleaseItemResponse {
  agent: AgentName | null;  // null when no claim existed
}
```

This change makes the endpoint idempotent: releasing a non-existent claim returns `released: false, agent: null` instead of an error.

#### Database Indexes

Added performance indexes on frequently queried columns:
- `Item.stageId`: Stage filtering queries
- `Item.projectId`: Project isolation queries
- `Item.archivedAt`: Soft delete filtering
- `Item.assignedAgent`: Agent status queries
- `Mission.projectId`: Project mission queries
- `Mission.archivedAt`: Mission archival queries
- `ActivityLog.projectId`: Project activity queries

#### Type Organization

Consolidated project types with existing API response types in `src/types/api.ts`.

### Fixed

#### Race Condition in Item Claim

- Fixed concurrent claim requests via unique constraint on `AgentClaim`
- Added `CLAIM_CONFLICT` error code for race condition detection
- `createClaimConflictError()` factory for consistent error handling

#### Stage Transition Validation

- Improved validation matrix for all stage transitions
- Dependency cycle detection in transition operations
- Force override flag for WIP limit bypass with explicit override

### Testing

- Added comprehensive tests for multi-project support
- Project isolation integration tests
- Output file collision detection tests
- Error factory function unit tests
- Database index validation tests
- 100+ new tests across project and error handling

### Technical Details

**Prisma Migrations**
- Project model with cascading relationships
- Foreign key constraints on all project-scoped tables
- Database constraints ensure referential integrity

**Environment Support**
- SQLite database auto-creates project tables on first use
- No manual migration required for existing deployments
- Backward-compatible with single-project deployments

- `final_review`: Lynch performs holistic review of all completed items
- `post_checks`: Automated verification (lint, typecheck, test, build)
- `documentation`: Tawnia updates docs and creates final commit
- `complete`: Mission finished with summary

**New SSE Events**

- `post-checks-started`: Emitted when automated checks begin
- `post-check-update`: Emitted for each check result (lint, typecheck, test, build)
- `post-checks-complete`: Emitted with all check results
- `documentation-started`: Emitted when Tawnia begins docs
- `documentation-complete`: Emitted with commit hash and summary

#### Agent Assignment Bug Fix

Fixed bug where assigned agents weren't appearing on work item cards during moves.

**Root Cause**
- When an item moved AND its content changed (to add `assigned_agent`), the SSE endpoint skipped the content-change event because it had already processed a move event for that item in the same debounce window

**Fix**
- Modified `createItemMovedEvent` to include full item data
- Updated `ItemMovedEvent` type to include optional `item` field
- Updated `useBoardEvents` hook callback to pass item through
- Updated page component to use full item data when updating state

#### Agent Status Bar Bug Fix

Fixed bug where agent status bar always showed "IDLE" even when agents were actively working.

**Root Cause**
- Agent status was read from `board.json`'s agents section, which was never updated by orchestration scripts

**Fix**
- Created `deriveAgentStatusesFromWorkItems()` utility function
- Agents assigned to items in active stages (probing, testing, implementing, review) now show as ACTIVE
- Status updates in real-time as items move through the pipeline

### Changed
