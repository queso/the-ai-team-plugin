2026-01-20T18:56:20.281Z [Murdock] Started work on 001
2026-01-20T19:04:32.038Z [Murdock] ✓ 001: Created 36 test cases covering AgentName (Tawnia), MissionPhase, CheckResult, FinalReviewStatus, PostChecksStatus, DocumentationStatus, BoardMetadata extensions, and Mission.status extensions. TypeScript compilation errors confirm missing types that B.A. must implement.

2026-01-20T19:06:15.281Z [B.A.] ✓ 001: Implemented all mission completion types: AgentName includes Tawnia (7 agents), MissionPhase, CheckResultStatus, CheckResult, FinalReviewStatus, PostChecksStatus, DocumentationStatus interfaces, extended BoardMetadata with optional finalReview/postChecks/documentation fields, extended Mission.status with new phases. All 36 type tests passing.

2026-01-20T19:07:17.218Z [Lynch] ✓ 001: APPROVED - All 36 type tests pass. Implementation correctly defines all required types: AgentName (7 agents incl Tawnia), MissionPhase, CheckResult, FinalReviewStatus, PostChecksStatus, DocumentationStatus, extends BoardMetadata and Mission.status. TypeScript errors in other files are expected downstream effects of adding Tawnia to AgentName.
